## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a method of software development that uses software components called services to create business applications. Each service provides a business capability, and services can also communicate with each other across platforms and languages.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
Loose Coupling -> Services are like independent, stand-alone components that can operate independently. If one part changes, the others remain unaffected.
Interoperability -> Allows easy communication between components, even if they are built using different languages or technologies.
Discoverability -> It functions similarly to a menu, allowing you to view what's available and select what you need.
Reusability -> Performs a specific function and can be used in multiple contexts. It is comparable to owning a multipurpose instrument.
Flexibility -> Allowing you to add or change services without causing major delays. This is similar to moving furniture around a room without rearranging the entire property.
3. Define Microservices.
Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.
Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features.
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
Scalability -> We can make efficient use of resources by allowing separate parts of the system to scale up or down on their own.
Agility and Faster Development -> Different parts of a system can be updated and released individually and quickly. It speeds everything up, like working on many small projects at once.
Improved Maintainability -> improve the understanding and maintenance of specific parts of the system without affecting other parts. Allows you to make changes to one without affecting the others.
Independent Deployability -> A part of the system can be updated or changed without affecting the entire operation.
Technology Diversity -> Allow us to use different technologies for different parts of the system. It makes everything more versatile, like how different tools are used for different jobs.
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
Building Blocks -> Both service-oriented architecture and microservices divide software into simpler, easier-to manage independent components.
Flexible Connections -> For flexibility, they both promote weak connections between these parts of the building.
Business Alignment -> Their respective goals are to match these blocks to specific business operations or capacities.
